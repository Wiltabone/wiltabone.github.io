Delivered a guest lecture on 'Using LLMs for HCI research' as part of the 'AI in Experience Design' Master Class held at TU Delft. I explained to attendees from industry how Large Language Models could be used to assess qualitative (think-aloud, interviews, questionnaires) and quantitative data (rating scales) to draw concrete conclusions from human-subject research.

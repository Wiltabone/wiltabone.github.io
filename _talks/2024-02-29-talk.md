Attended by invitation, the AlUla Future Culture Summit in Saudi Arabia. It was fantastic to share a number of exchanges with world leaders in the museum, art and culture sectors, as we discussed the future of a number of world heritage sites. Thanful for the invitation, and the opportunity to discuss my passion of scientific application to the arts with fellow peers.

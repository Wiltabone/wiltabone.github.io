I’m Wilbert Tabone, a techie interested in the arts. I specialise in User Experience (UX) design, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Extended Reality (XR) development. I’m passionate about shaping the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence (AI), Digital Cultural Heritage, and Computational Art .

  <p> I’m currently engaged as a PhD Candidate at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/w.tabone/"> Delft University of Technology </a>, focusing on cognitive human-robot interaction, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.c.f.dewinter/"> Prof. Joost de Winter </a>, and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.happee/"> Prof. Riender Happee </a>. My research forms part of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action Innovative Training Network project <a href ="https://www.shape-it.eu/esr/esr-9-assessing-interactions-between-avs-vrus-using-virtual-augmented-reality/"> SHAPE-IT </a>, which aims to enable the rapid and reliable development of safe and user-centred automated vehicles for urban environments. </p>

  <p>My particular area of focus is the development of AR and VR technologies to asses the interactions between automated vehicles and other road users and the development of interfaces to inform humans on the AI’s intentions. </p>

**Other roles**

Previous to this role, I was spearheading creative computing development in the Maltese heritage sector and formed part of the <a href="https://malta.ai/"> Malta National AI Task Force </a>, which was appointed by the Government to formulate Malta’s strategy on AI.

    <p> Separate from professional life, I am actively involved in the cultural, technology and education sectors and serve as an activist for a number of Maltese and international NGOs, including the Commonwealth Youth Council, civil rights movements, and the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality. I have also been actively involved in the National Youth Parliament, and I also take a keen interest in classical voice training, opera, theatre, history and astronomy. </p>

Greetings! I’m Wilbert Tabone, a techie interested in the arts. I specialise in User Experience (UX) design, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Mixed Reality (MR) development. I’m passionate about shaping the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence (AI), Digital Cultural Heritage and Computational Art .

I’m currently engaged as a researcher on a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action Innovative Training Network project which aims to enable the rapid and reliable development of safe and user-centred automated vehicles (AVs) for urban environments. My particular area of focus is the development of AR and VR technologies to asses the interactions between automated vehicles and other road users and the development of interfaces to inform humans on the AI’s intentions. Previous to this role, I was spearheading creative computing development in the Maltese heritage sector and formed part of the Malta National AI Task Force, which was appointed by the Government to formulate Malta’s strategy on AI.

Separate from professional life, I am also involved in a number of organisation and humanitarian roles including being an ambassador and member of the Europe and Africa Committee within the Commonwealth Youth Council, where I strive for a fairer, safer and sustainable future for the coming generations. I also take a keen interest in classical voice training, opera, theatre, history and astronomy.
